    <h1 class="no-top-margin">Introduction</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome to Illustrator 2. This class is meant to serve as a continuation of what you learned in Illustrator 1 and a guide to creating advanced artwork in Illustrator.</p>
    
    <h2>About This Class</h2>
    
    <p>This manual serves two main purposes</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><p>The exercises will give you step-by-step instructions in creating projects that utilize many of the tools offered in Illustrator.</p></li>
        <li><p>The manual serves as a means to familiarize yourself with some of the intermediate and advanced tools in Adobe Illustrator. This class will also review key tools and concepts from Illustrator 1. The topics we will be covering include using Layers, working with color, placing and tracing images, adding and editing text, distorting text using warp tools, exploring Illustrator effects, exploring the Appearance panel, using patterns and symbols, and exporting your final project.</p></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    
    <p>This class requires a basic familiarity with the Windows or Macintosh operating system, and previous attendance of Illustrator 1 or equivalent experience.</p>
    
    <h2>Other Requirements</h2>
    
    <p>This class requires the Illustrator 2 class files folder provided by STS, as well as a computer with Adobe Illustrator. The project was created with Illustrator CC 2015, but you will be able to complete the project with other versions of Illustrator as well.</p>
    
    <h2>Today's Projects</h2>
    
    <p>The two projects you will work on are promotional materials for a library. The first project will be a postcard that highlights upcoming events, and the second will be a poster advertising one of the specific events.</p>
    
    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    
    <p>To start our project, we need to create a new Illustrator document and set up our workspace.</p>
    
    <h3>Exercise: Creating a New Document</h3>
    
    <p>When creating a new document, it is important to keep in mind what kind of project you will be working on. This exercise reviews how to create a new document. For this class, we will begin by making a postcard, and so will want a smaller art board to work with.</p>
    
    <ol class="instruction-list">
    
        <li><p>Open Illustrator and create a new file by going to <span class="type-text">File > New</span> in the menu bar.</p></li>
        <li><p>Name the new file "Postcard". Adjust the settings as follows:
           <ul>
               <li><p>Units: Inches</p></li>
               <li><p>Height: 4.25 inches</p></li>
               <li><p>Width: 6 inches</p></li>
               <li><p>Orientation: Landscape</p></li>
               <li><p>Bleed: 0.125 inches</p></li>
               <li><p>Color Mode: CMYK</p></li>
           </ul>
        <li><p>Click OK.</p></li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/postcard-newdocument.png" /> </div>
    
    <h2>Setting up the Workspace</h2>
    
    <div class="sidebar-note">
        <h2>Windows</h2>
        <p>Note that on PC versions of Illustrator, the Application Frame is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The workspace can be set up in several different ways, depending on how you prefer to work. Many designers find that turning on the <b>Application Frame</b> helps to keep the workspace and tools organized. To turn on the Application Frame for a Mac, navigate to the menu bar and choose <span class="type-text"> Window > Application Frame</span></p>
    
    <p>Another way to configure the layout is by using the <b>Workspace Layout</b> options. The Workspace Layout determines what panels and options are available to you in your Illustrator interface. We'll be using the Essentials layout in the class, as it has a layout that includes most of the panels we will need for these projects. To switch workspace layouts, navigate to the menu bar and choose <span class="type-text"> Window > Workspace > Essentials</span></p>
    

    <br />
    
    <h2>Planning the Document</h2>
    
    <p>We are now ready to begin designing the basic layout of our poster. Before we lay out some more features of the document, we need to make sure we have a plan for our design.</p>
    
    <p>When creating a complex document, layout and organization should be planned before adding text, graphics, or formatting. Before designing any publication, it is important to keep in mind some basic design principles such as consistency, legibility, clear choices regarding graphics, and general composition. We will explore each of these principles as we work through today’s project. In addition, there are many useful books and websites that provide information about design principles.</p>
    
    <h2>The Layers Panel</h2>
    
    <p>Now that your document is created and your workspace is set up correctly, we can explore one of the most important organizing tools in Adobe Illustrator: layers. Using the Layers panel not only helps you to organize your work, but allows others to easily navigate through your project when sharing files.</p>
    
    <p>A single layer is conceptually a transparent sheet, allowing you to add content to as many layers or “transparency sheets” as you would like, while being able to see the content on other layers as well. You can then reorder and rename layers, hide them, or lock them to aid work flow on your project.</p>
    
    <div class="centered-image-large">
        <img src="images/postcard-layerspanel.png" />
        <p>To change the title of the layer, double-click on the title and rename the layer.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The two boxes to the left of each layer name indicate visibility and locking of the layers. Clicking in the first of the two boxes toggles the visibility of a layer. This is useful when you want to focus on specific layers without being distracted by others.</p>
    
    <p>Clicking in the second of the two boxes locks or unlocks a layer. When you lock a layer, you are unable to make any changes to that layer. It is useful to lock layers that you want to leave unadjusted, such as the background, while you work on the rest of your document.</p>
    
    <h3>Exercise: Making New Layers</h3>
    
    <div class="side-image-large"> <img src="images/postcard-newlayers.png" /> </div>
    
    <p>The first thing we want to do in the layers panel is create several layers that will organize our project into workable sections.</p>
    
    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li><p>Create four more layers in addition to the original layer, using the create new layer button.</p></li>
        <li><p>Name the layers "Image", "Shapes", "Text", "Logo", and "Guides"</p></li>
        <li><p>Arrange them from top to bottom, with "Image" being at the bottom, then "Shapes", "Text", "Logo", and finally, "Guides" at the top.</p></li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Exercise: Creating Guides</h3>
    
    <p>Guides are important when organizing a document. We want to get an idea of the layout for our poster, so we will use Guides to create a rough template for ourselves.</p>
    
    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li><p>To create guides, you must enable rulers. Rulers appear at the top and left side of your workspace, so you can measure objects more easily. Go to the menu bar and choose <span class="type-text">View > Rulers > Show Rulers</span></p></li>
        <li><p>Select the Guides layer to ensure you will be creating the guides in it.</p></li>
        <li><p>To create guides, click into the top ruler, hold, and drag down. You should see a blue line following your cursor. We will create quarter-inch margins for this postcard with the guides. Pulling from the top ruler will create horizontal guides, pulling from the left ruler will create vertical guides.</p></li>
        <li><p>Once you have marked off the margins with the guides, you can use a few more to break up the rest of your document, and delineate the layout. For this project, marking off a right column and a top header area might be beneficial. We will be putting key information in the header and using the sidebar for the logo and address of the library.</p></li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/postcard-guides.png" /> </div>
    
    
    <h1>Working with Shapes and Color</h1>
    
    <p>In order to make a background for our postcard, we will utilize shapes to delineate the layout of the postcard. You already have experience making shapes in Illustrator 1; we will review using the pen tool and rectangle tool in this section, and then play with color options and effects.</p>
    
    <h3>Exercise: Create background shapes</h3>
    <img class="sidebar-icon" src="images/icon-pen.png" />
    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li><p>Click into the Shapes layer and select the pen tool.</p></li>
        <li><p>Creating only straight lines and angles, use the pen tool to draw out a sort of L shape along the top of the postcard, and the right side. Remember to include the bleed space, as indicated by the red line. Give it a color fill for the time being, so you can see the shape.</p></li>
        <img class="sidebar-icon" src="images/icon-rectangle.png" />
        <li><p>Use the rectangle tool to draw out a different color rectangle filling the rest of the artboard.</p></li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="sidebyside-image-large"> <img src="images/postcard-background-1.png" /> <img src="images/postcard-background-2.png" /> </div>
    
    <h3>Exercise: Creating swatches and using gradients</h3>
    
    <p>We're going to add gradients to both of our shapes to blend them together and add some color variation in the postcard. First, we need to find the colors we want to use. We will select shades of green and blue, in addition to white.</p>
    
    <ol class="instruction-list">
        
        <li><p>Select the large L shape with the direct selection tool and go to the Color panel. Use the color spectrum in this panel to find a shade of blue that you like.</p></li>
        
        <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/postcard-colorpanel.png" /> </div>
        
        <li><p>Navigate to <span class="type-text">Window > Swatches</span> in the menu bar.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>With this shape still selected, click the create new swatch button in this panel.</p></li>
        
        <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/postcard-swatches.png" /> </div>
        
        <div class="side-image-large"> <img src="images/postcard-newswatch.png" /> </div>
        
        <li><p>In the dialogue box that appears, name it something distinctive, like "Background Blue", and click OK.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat steps 1-4 to find a shade of green you like, and turn it into a swatch called "Background-Green".</p></li>
        <li><p>Select the large L shape with the direct selection tool and go to <span class="type-text">Window > Gradient</span> in the menu bar.</p></li>
        <li><p>Change both of the gradient boxes from black and white to your chosen green and blue swatches, which are now saved as swatches that you can access from the gradient panel.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add another color to the gradient, and make it white. Adjust the gradient on a 45 degree angle.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the same gradient to the other shape, and adjust it to be on a -120 degree angle. Feel free to play with the distribution of the colors in order to make it more fluid.</p></li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Adding Effects</h3>
    
    <div class="side-image-large"> <img src="images/postcard-dropshadow.png" /> </div>
    
    <p>We will use a drop shadow to add some dimension to the background, and make the layout more distinctive.</p>
    
    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li><p>Select the rectangle shape with the direct selection tool.</p></li>
        <li><p>Go to <span class="type-text">Effect > Illustrator Effects: Stylize > Drop Shadow</span></p></li>
        <li><p>In the dialogue box, click Preview, and then adjust the Drop Shadow options, either as in the image, or with other settings you prefer.</p></li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/postcard-backgroundshapes.png" /> </div>
    
    
    <h1>Working with Images: Part 1</h1>
    
    <p>Incorporating graphics intp publications can be tricky. <span class="highlight">High-quality digitized graphics are ideal for use in publications.</span> Many times, photographs are taken from digital cameras, scanned into the computer, or created from digital graphics applications.</p>
    
    <p>Illustrator can incorporate many types of graphics. After a graphic is placed into an Illustrator document, minor adjustments may be made so that it looks its best.</p>
    
    <h2>Using Graphics for Communication</h2>
    
    <p>Remember that the intention of a publication is to communicate a specific message to a target audience. Every graphic should enhance this message. If too many graphics or unrelated graphics appear in the publication, they may draw the audience’s attention away from the intended message. However, graphics are still important. Without graphics, a publication may not catch the audience’s attention at all.</p>
    
    <p>In our postcard, we will layer an image of water underneath our shapes in order to highlight the theme of the featured events, which is books about voyages. This will add a texture to the background of the images, which will create more visual interest. Later, we will utilize this same image in a different way for a flyer for one of the events, which will create consistency between promotional materials. We will also use the same logo image in both projects.</p>
    
    <h2>Understanding Graphic Formats</h2>
    
    <p>There are many computer-generated graphic formats. Choosing the wrong type of file format when creating a graphic can affect the size and quality of graphics. A few formats are popular and widely accepted by many programs. For printing, the two most widely used graphic formats are <b>TIFF</b> and <b>EPS</b>. <b>JPEG</b> and <b>GIF</b> are not advised for printed publications. The following is an explanation of the four types:</p>
    
    <p><b>TIFF</b> stands for <b>Tagged Image File Format.</b> Like most graphic formats, these files are bitmap graphics (based on pixels). TIFF files can be in black and white, grayscale, or full color. If a TIFF is enlarged, the graphic quality may be reduced. TIFF files are best suited for graphics that are scanned into the computer or created with Adobe Photoshop.</p>
    
    <p><b>EPS</b> stands for <b>Encapsulated PostScript.</b> Graphics in the EPS file format may contain vector graphics (based on objects) as well as bitmap graphics. They can also be in black and white, grayscale, or full color. These graphics can be imported into almost all page layout and word processing programs, and they can be enlarged without sacrificing graphic quality. Graphics created with a vector-based drawing system, such as Adobe Illustrator or Freehand, should be saved in this format.</p>
    
    <p><b>GIF</b> and <b>JPEG</b> stand for <b>Graphic Interchange Format</b> and <b>Joint Photographic Experts Group</b>, respectively. These formats were designed with the World Wide Web in mind, so they are much smaller in file size than TIFF and EPS files. However, GIF and JPEG files do not print out as well as TIFF and EPS files. Therefore, avoid using GIF and JPEG files in print publications.</p>
    
    <h2>Understanding Image Resolution</h2>
    
    <p>Both printed and digital graphics are actually made up of tiny dots that hold color information. When the dots are blended together, they form a picture. <b>Image resolution</b> refers to the number of <b>dots per square inch</b>, or <b>dpi</b>, of the image file. High resolution images are sharper or clearer than low resolution images. High resolution digital images are also larger in file size.</p>
    
    <p>Controlling image resolution is especially important for TIFF files. If an image is scanned in at a low resolution, enlarging the image will result in poor image quality. However, scanning images in at a very high resolution makes file sizes very large. A good rule of thumb is to use a resolution of 150 dpi for line art and 200 dpi for photographic images. This will give a good balance between acceptable print quality and manageable file size. However, for printing large photos on glossy paper, an image resolution between 300 and 600 dpi is recommended.</p>
    
    <p>Although images may be resized when they reach a publication, excessive shrinking or enlarging of graphics produces undesirable results. If a small picture is over-stretched, the pixels themselves become overblown and the picture looks jagged. If a large picture is reduced after it is imported into a publication, the result may look fine but the file size of the graphic remains unnecessarily large.</p>
    
    <h3>Exercise: Placing Images</h3>
    
    <p>Before we place the file, we will activate the Selection tool. We want the freedom to move this graphic to an exact place within our publication, which means we want the graphic to be placed as an independent graphic.</p>
    
    <div class="sidebar-note">
    	<h2>Resizing Proportionally</h2>
    	<p>Holding down the <kbd>shift</kbd> key while you drag the handles around the image will constrain the proportions of the image.</p>
    </div>
    
    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li><p>Lock and hide the shapes layer, and click into the Image layer below it.</p></li>
        <li><p>Choose <span class="type-text">File > Place</span></p></li>
        <li><p>Browse to the <span class="type-text">WaterBackground.tif</span> file.</p></li>
        <li><p>Click Place.</p></li>
        <li><p>Click into the artboard, placing the image. We see handles around the graphic, which are used to resize a graphic. Use the anchor points and the direct selection tool to make it the size of the artboard. Adjusting it unproportionally is not a problem with this particular image, as it is mainly intended for texture.</p></li>
        
        <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/postcard-image.png" /> </div> 
        
        <div class="side-image-medium"> <img src="images/postcard-opacity.png" /> </div>
        
        <li><p>Reveal the shapes layer and lower the opacity of each shape to about 50%, using the options bar.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>Place the <span class="type-text">logo.png</span> file and put it in the upper right-hand corner of the postcard. Adjust the size as necessary.</p></li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/postcard-backgroundfinished.png" /> </div>
    
    
    
    <h1>Working with Type: Part 1</h1>
    
    <p>Point type is a horizontal or vertical line of text that begins where you click and expands as you enter characters. Each line of text is independent, with the line expanding or shrinking as you type, but does not return to the next line. Entering text this way is useful for adding a few words to your artwork instead of full paragraphs. You can also click and drag to create text boxes, if you need to measure out space for your text. The same tool in Illustrator, the Type tool, is used for both.</p>
    
    <h3>Exercise: Using the Type Tool</h3>
    
    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <img class="sidebar-icon" src="images/icon-type.png" />
        <li><p>Lock the Shapes layer and click into the Text layer, then select the Type tool.</p></li>
        <li><p>Click and drag a text box in the top of the document, and type "Central Library".</p></li>
        <li><p>Using the Character Panel, change the size to 32pt, the font to Modern No. 20.</p></li>
        <li><p>Center the text using the Paragraph panel.</p></li>
        
        <div class="sidebyside-image-large"><img src="images/postcard-text.png" /> <img src="images/postcard-paragraph.png" /> </div>
        
        <li><p>Create type just below that says "PRESENTS" in all caps.</p></li>
        <li><p>Create several other text boxes, filling the postcard with contact information for the library, and a list of events. You can copy and paste text from the <span class="type-text">library.txt</span> file, and then format it.</p></li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/postcard-type.png" /> </div>
    
    <h2>Tracking and Leading</h2>

    <div class="side-image-medium"> <img src="images/postcard-tracking.png" /> </div>
    <p><b>Tracking</b> controls the white space between characters in an entire block of text. Tracking and kerning are typographic terms that have to do with the space between characters.The default tracking settings for body text are usually adequate, but larger display text can often be adjusted for presentation purposes. Highlight the text that says "PRESENTS" and increase the tracking in the Character panel to 100.</p>
    
    <div class="sidebyside-image-large"><img src="images/postcard-beforetracking.png" /> <img src="images/postcard-aftertracking.png" /> </div>
    
    <div class="side-image-medium"> <img src="images/postcard-leading.png" /> </div>
    
    <p><b>Leading</b> controls the white space between lines of text. This can be useful when you want to delinieate information more clearly if it occurs on several lines of text. Highlight the contact information for the library and increase the leading in the Character panel to 18.</p>
    
    <div class="sidebyside-image-small"><img src="images/postcard-beforeleading.png" /> <img src="images/postcard-afterleading.png" /> </div>
    
    <div class="centered-image.medium"> <img src="images/postcard-finished.png" /> </div>
    
    <h1>Working with Images: Part 2</h1>
    
    <p>For the this project, we will work with more advanced Illustrator tools to create a promotional flyer.</p>
    
    <ol class="instruction-list">
    
        <li><p>Open Illustrator and create a new file by going to <span class="type-text">File > New</span> in the menu bar.</p></li>
        <li><p>Name the new file "flyer". Adjust the settings as follows:
           <ul>
               <li><p>Units: Inches</p></li>
               <li><p>Height: 11 inches</p></li>
               <li><p>Width: 8.5 inches</p></li>
               <li><p>Orientation: Portrait</p></li>
               <li><p>Bleed: 0.125 inches</p></li>
               <li><p>Color Mode: CMYK</p></li>
           </ul>
        <li><p>Click OK.</p></li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="centered-image-large"><img src="images/flyer-newdocument.png" /></div>

    
    <h3>Exercise: Image Trace</h3>
    
    <p>Image trace converts raster images into editable vector images. It is an extremely powerful tool in Illustrator, and can be useful to use with a variety of images, including scanned images, or even photography. Image trace can be finicky however, and it is important to understand its limitations as well as its complexities when using it.</p>
    
    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li><p>Navigate to <span class="type-text">File > Place</span></p>
        	<ol class="instruction-list">
        		<li><p>Browse to the waves.jpg in the class files, and click OK.</p></li>

        <li><p>Navigate to <span class="type-text">Window > Image Trace</span></p>
        
        	<ol class="instruction-list">
        		<li><p>Click the "preview" button. The waves image will transform into a black and white traced version of the original photo. This is the automatic setting of the image trace.</p></li>
        		<div class="side-image-large"><img src="images/2ImgTrace.png"/></div>
        		<li><p>Change the Preset to '3 color'. If you wish to increase or decrease the number of colors used for tracing, you may adjust the 'Colors' setting.</p></li>
        		<li><p>At the bottom of the panel, there is information about the tracing, including the number of paths, anchors and colors present in the trace. Once we are satisfied with all of the settings, we can close the Image Trace panel and move on to convert our trace to paths.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Press the 'Expand' button in the control panel.</strong> Expanding the artwork allows us to divide the single object into multiple objects that make up its appearance (paths). Expanding the image should be the last step of image tracing, because you will no longer be able to edit the image trace.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>After you click expand, all the paths will be highlighted with the color of the Image layer to show that they exist as separate paths. Click anywhere on the artboard to see the image without the blue highlights.</p></li>

        <li><p>To select an individual path, with the Direct Selection tool selected, click an individual path. Now we can edit the image like any other object in Illustrator. </p></li>
        
        <li><p>In order to enhance the appearance of waves, we will "clean up" some of the smaller paths in our result.</p></li>
        
        <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/3RemPaths.gif" /></div>
        
        <li><p>The final result from the traced image should look something like this:</p></li>
        
        <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/3WavesFinal.png" /></div>
        
        <li><p><strong>Optional:</strong> To create an interesting color contrast, we can create a black background behind the waves.</p></li>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
        		<li><p>Create a new layer called 'Background'. Make sure it is below the waves layer.</p></li>
        		<li><p>Using the rectangle tool, Place a rectangle over the full page.</p></li>

    </ol>
    
    
    <h1>Patterns and Swatches</h1>
    
    <p>In this section, we will create our own pattern, and save color swatches. These skills can be very useful when working on large projects in Adobe Illustrator, where you are using a specific color scheme.</p>
    
    <p></p>
    
    <h2>Patterns</h2>
    
    <p>Patterns are a group of vector objects with rectangular borders, called a tile. This source tile is saved as a pattern. The source tile can be edited in the Patterns panel. To form the seamless pattern texture, the saved source is automatically tiled horizontally and vertically.</p>
    
    <p>The tile direction is guided by rulers in the Illustrator document. Patterns usually start from the lower-left corner of the document. When the pattern is applied to a vector object as a fill or stroke, the result is a pixel-based image. However, it is still scalable because the source title is vector based, so the quality remains intact.</p>
    
    <p>We are going to create a wave pattern, which will be added to our traced anf expanded image.</p>
    
    <div class="side-image-large"><img src="images/4Layers.png" /> </div>
    
    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li><p>Lock and hide the rectangle layer, and the </p></li>
        <p><strong>Optional:</strong> For organizational purposes, we can rename 'Layer 1' by double-clicking on the title.
        We can title the layers "Waves" and "Background".</p>
        <li><p>Create a new sublayer under 'Waves', called 'Pattern', where we will design a new pattern.</p>
        <div class="side-image-large"><img src="images/6PenLine.gif"/> </div>
        	<ol class="instruction-list">
        		<li><p>Create a 'Medium Blue' square (hold down shift) using the rectangle tool. Make the square 0.3 x 0.3 inches.</p></li>
        		
        		<li><p>Using the pen tool, create a straight line (click and release at one spot, and while holding down the shift key, click and release again).</p></li>
        		
        		<li><p>Make the stroke of the line 1pt, and the color 'Light Blue'.</p></li>
        		
        		<li><p>With the line selected, Navigate to <span class="type-text">Effect > Distort & Transform > Zig Zag</span></p></li>
        		<li><p>Select the following settings:</p></li>
        		
        		<div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/7ZigZag.png" /></div>
        		<li><p>We have completed the basic shape. Now we want to repeat it and create a new pattern.</p></li>
        	</ol></li>
        
        <div class="side-image-medium"><img src="images/PatternSettings.png" /></div>
        
        <li><p>Using the selection tool, select both the square and the wave.</p></li>
        <li><p>Navigate to <span class="type-text">Object > Pattern > Make</span></p></li>
        <li><p>The Pattern editing mode opens. We want to set the following settings:</p></li>
        
    </ol>
    
    <p>Your pattern is now available in the swatches panel for use.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Optional: </strong>We can now apply our new pattern to any object in illustrator. In this example, we will change the fill of the medium blue waves to this pattern:</p>
    
    <div class="centered-image-large"><img src="images/WavesWPattern.png" /></div>
    
    
    <h2>Swatches</h2>
    
    <p>Swatches are named colors, tints, gradients, and patterns. The swatches associated with a document appear in the Swatches panel. Swatches can appear individually or in groups.</p>
    
    <p>You can open libraries of swatches from other Illustrator documents and various color systems. Swatch libraries appear in separate panels and are not saved with the document.</p>


    <h3>Exercise: Creating Swatches for the Flyer</h3>

    <p>In this exercise, we’ll save swatches of the colors to be used in our flyer. This helps us access a specific color, pattern, or gradient, and to maintain consistency throught the document.</p>
    
    <div class="side-image-small"><img src="images/eyedropperTool.png"/> </div>


    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li><p>Navigate to <span class="type-text">Window > Swatches</span></p></li>
        <li><p>Using the Eyedropper tool, click on the light blue color in the waves (Waves layer muct be unlocked). You will know that the color is selected, when it appears in the Fill box.</p></li>
        <li><p>In the Swatches window, press the folder icon (New Color Group). A new folder should appear in the Swatches window.</p></li>
        <li><p>With the 'Waves' folder selected, press the 'New Swatch' icon. You can title the swatch "Light Blue".</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat step 4 with the two other shades of blue (medium, dark).</p></li>
    </ol>
    
	<div class="centered-image-medium"><img src="images/SwatchesWindow.png" /></div>

    <h1>Working with Type: Part 2</h1>
    
    <h3>Exercise: Envelope Distortion</h3>
    
    <p>We will be creating a title for our flyer by manipulating the text objects. This will be the resulting title graphic:</p>
    
    <div class="centered-image-large"><img src="images/TitleFinal.png" /></div>
    
    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li><p>Using the 'Fish' layer which is already in the flyer document, we will add text using two different methods.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>Create a new text object, which contains "UNDER THE SEA". For the model, we used <span class="type-text">Krungthep</span> for the font, and <span class="type-text">40 pt</span> for the font size.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>Place the text object below the middle section of the fish: <span class="type-text">Object > Arrange > Bring to Back</span></p></li>
        
        <li><p>Select the text object and the middle shape. Navigate to <span class="type-text">Object > Envelope Distort > Make with Top Object</span></p></li>
        
        <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/TopObjWarp.gif" /></div>
        
        <li><p>Finally, change the font color of the middle section, and the other objects to 'Light Blue'.</p></li>
    </ol>
    
    
    <h3>Exercise: Type on Path Tool</h3>
    
    <p>The Type tool allows the user to type on paths created in Illustrator. Type on a path flows along the edge of an open or a closed path. We will use this tool to add the subheader "Viewing and Discussion".</p>
    
    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li><p>First, we will create a curved path under the fish-shaped title. We will be using the pen tool, and manually creating the path:</p></li>
        
        <li><p>Once the path is created, we will use the Type on Path tool, and write "Viewing and Discussion".</p></li>
        
        <div class="centered-image-medium"><img src="images/TypeOnPath.gif"/></div>
        
        
        <li><p>Change the font color to 'Medium Blue', and the font to <span class="type-text">Krungthep</span>.</p></li>
        
        <img class="side-image-small" src="images/icon-directselection.png" />
        
        <li><p>If you need to make any adjustments to the curve, or align it more accurately with the fish, use the 'Direct Selection' tool.</p></li>
    </ol>
    
    
    <p>This is what our poster should look like so far:</p>
    
     <img class="side-image-medium" src="images/progressWFish.png" />
    <h3>Exercise: Adding Text, offset path</h3>
    
    <p>Next, we will generate the text on the poster (time, date, and information about the event).</p>
    
    <p>
    We are making an advertisement for a viewing and discussion of 3 films: The Little Mermaid, Jaws, and Finding Nemo.</p>
    
    <p>
    Our event will be held at College Library, on Monday, May 6 at 7pm. </p>
    
    
    <p>We will be combining both image trace and type tool in this exercise.</p>
    <p></p>
    
    <img class="side-image-medium" src="images/www.png" />
    
    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li><p>First, we are going to create 3 text fields: 
        "WHEN", "WHERE", and "WHAT". Use the settings on the right for the font and size specifications.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>Create a copy of the 3 text objects we create. With the copied "When","Where", and "What", we will convert text to a rasterized image. This means that we will no longer be able to edit these words using the type tool - they will now become pixel images.</p></li>
        <li><p>Now, we will create the outline for each of these text object:</p></li>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li><p>Select the copied text object, and then navigate to <span class="type-text">Object > Rasterize.</span> This turns the text to an image object.</p></li>
            <li><p>Next, we will image trace the raster image, and expand it. <span class="type-text">Object > Image Trace > Make and Expand.</span></p></li>
            <li><p>Ungroup the traced image, and erase the white background.</p></li>
            <li><p>We will add an offset path. Select the image, and navigate to <span class="type-text">Object > Path > Offset Path</span>. Choose the following settings:</p></li>
            
            <p>Offset: 0.09 inches</p> 
            <p>Joins: Round</p> 
            <p>Miter limit: 4</p>
            
            <li><p>Set the color of the objects to 'light blue'.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Finally, make sure the original text objects (When, What, Where) are arranged in front. Place them over the respective image objects.</p></li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="centered-image-medium"><img src="images/wwwResult.png"/></div>
        
        <li><p>We will complete the poster, by adding the actual details under the subheadings. Fill in the following information, using the Type tool:</p></li>
        
        <p>Where: College Library</p> 
        <p>When: Monday, May 6</p> 
        <p>What: Compare & Contrast (The Little Mermaid, Jaws, Finding Nemo)</p>
        
        <li><p>This should our resulting poster:</p></li>
        
        <div class="centered-image-large"><img src="images/finalPoster.png"/></div>
    </ol>
    
    <h1>Saving and Exporting</h1>
    
    <p>Saving and exporting the document to a PDF or TIFF allows the document to be opened by those who do not have Illustrator so you can share your document. Most printing clients, including StudentPrint on campus, will prefer to work with PDFs.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><p>To save as a PDF, go to <span class="type-text">File > Save As</span>. In the Format drop down menu, select Adobe PDF and click save.</p></li>
        <li><p>To export a TIFF, go to <span class="type-text">File > Export As</span>. In the Format drop down menu, select TIFF and click export.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you would like to export as PNG (used for images without backgrounds) or JPG, you will also navigate to <span class="type-text">File > Export As</span>, and select your preferd file type.</p></li>
        <li><p>Finally, if you are not finished with your project on Adobe Illustrator, it is important to save it as an Illustrator file - This way, your History and progress are saved, as well as your layers, patterns, and swatches. Go to <span class="type-text">File > Save As</span>, and select <span class="type-text">Adobe Illustrator (ai).</span></p></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Packaging</h2>
    
    <p>Oftentimes, a project in Adobe Illustrator requires many attachments, fonts, and imported images (as do our projects).</p>
    
    <p>In order to ensure that the attachments are displayed properly in any directory / on any device, we must 'package' our project. Of course, this is only necessary if you would like to export the project as an Adobe Illustrator file.</p>
    
    <p>If you would like to package your project in Adobe Illustrator, go to <span class="type-text">File > Package</span>. This way, all of the external information contained in the file will be saved to a folder.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Best Practices</h1>
    
    <p>Congratulations on creating two projects in Adobe Illustrator! It is now up to you to use the skills you have learned in this and other Illustrator classes to keep making awesome designs. Here are some things to consider:</p>
	<p>Be consistent with your project's color and style palettes.</p>
	<p>Adding drop shadows, glow effects, or strokes to elements of your design makes them more visible and attention-grabbing. This is a good technique to create a focal point in your poster’s composition.</p>
	<p>Gradients can add a lot of interest to a design, especially when applied to backgrounds. Be careful, though, that they do not decrease the readability of your poster. </p>
	<p>Speaking of readability, keep in mind the size of your project. A postcard will be viewed close up, while a flyer or poster will most often be viewed from 10 to 20 feet away. Make sure your text is a reasonable size and remember to use a readable typeface.</p>
   
    <h1>Appendix: Advanced Image Trace</h1>
    
    <p>The Image Trace panel has many more options for you to use, and this section will go over the advanced image trace options in more detail.</p>
    
    <p>To access the Advanced Options, Click the arrow next to “Advanced” to extend the panel window.</p>
    
	<p>The first category is <b>Paths</b>. This determines the detail of the artwork. If you drag the slider to the left, the image loosley adheres to the image. If you drag the slider to the right, the paths of the artwork tighten and follow the contours of the original artwork more closely.</p>
	
	<p>The next category is <b>Corners</b>. This determines the number of corners in the paths of the artwork. If you drag the slider to the right, the number of corners in the artwork increases. This can sometimes leave jagged lines and extra white space. If you drag the
slider to the left, the paths smooth out, especially in detailed areas like around a face structure or hairlines.</p>

	<p>The next category is <b>Noise</b>. This determines the amount of detail, or noise, the image contains. The higher the number of pixels, the less noise in the photo and the smaller details are ignored. The lower the number of pixels, the more noise in the photo and smaller details in the image are picked up.</p>

	<p>The next category is <b>Method</b>. This determines how the paths interact with each other in the image. The first square represents Abutting paths, which are paths that are cut out and fit right along each others’ edges like a puzzle. The second square represents Overlapping paths, which are solid shapes stacked on each other in layers. The most useful time to use the overlapping paths option is when you will be moving around parts of the image and do not want any white space between your pieces.</p>

 	<p>The next two categories, <b>Create</b> and <b>Stroke</b>, are used to edit the stroke and fills of the image. You can select either fills or stroke and then select the maximum width in pixels.</p>
	
	<p>The last category is the <b>Options</b>. You have the option of snapping the curves to lines, which would make all curved lines in the image straight. This is not particularly useful for all images because it can create gaps in the artwork. The other option is to ignore white, which ignores white parts of the picture and turns them transparent. This can be useful for single color logos scanned in on a piece of paper or other images where you do not want a white background.</p>
